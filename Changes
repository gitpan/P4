0.982 Tue Oct 23 2001
	- Fixed test.pl which was choking on test 6 due to ParseForms()
	  not having been called.

	- Fixed return scheme so that an empty list rather than undef
	  is returned in array context when there are no results.

0.960 Fri Oct 19 2001
	- Added sample code in example.pl

	- Changed SetXXX/GetXXX shortcuts to FetchXXX and SaveXXX since
	  GetClient()/SetClient() were already in use - damn!

	- Changed return scheme so that in scalar context Run() returns
	  an array reference if there is more than one result. Better
	  than a flat string which you then have to parse.

	- Added PPD file contributed by George Ibbott 
	  <gibbott@bakerstreettech.com>
