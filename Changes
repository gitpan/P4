Revision history for Perl extension P4.
1.4320 Wed Jun 09 2004

	- Bug fix. Fix the test script so that it handles both tagged and
	  non-tagged output for "p4 info". Tagged support for "p4 info" was
	  added in 2003.2. Thanks to Jeremy Bopp.

1.3550 Wed Aug 06 2003

	- Add support for OutputBinary() to P4Perl classes. This allow
	  "p4 print" to work with binary files, and text files on clients
	  with non-native line endings.

	- Re-add __END__ tag accidentally deleted in previous change

1.3537 Tue Aug 05 2003

	  P4::SetInput(). No functional change.

1.1733 Tue Apr 30 2002
	- Documentation update and GA release.

0.982 Tue Oct 23 2001
	- Fixed test.pl which was choking on test 6 due to ParseForms()
	  not having been called.

	- Fixed return scheme so that an empty list rather than undef
	  is returned in array context when there are no results.

0.960 Fri Oct 19 2001
	- Added sample code in example.pl

	- Changed SetXXX/GetXXX shortcuts to FetchXXX and SaveXXX since
	  GetClient()/SetClient() were already in use - damn!

	- Changed return scheme so that in scalar context Run() returns
	  an array reference if there is more than one result. Better
	  than a flat string which you then have to parse.

	- Added PPD file contributed by George Ibbott 
	  <gibbott@bakerstreettech.com>

0.931 Mon Oct 8 2001
	- Enhanced interface with some shortcuts for common functions
	  and made it easy to use the form parsing capabilities of 
	  P4::Client v 1.931.

0.10  Mon Oct  1 2001
	- Initial version.
