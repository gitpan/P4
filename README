P4 - Perl friendly OO interface to the Perforce SCM System
----------------------------------------------------------

This module provides an easy to use and very powerful interface to the
Perforce SCM system. It's based on the P4::Client module which 
binds the Perforce C++ API into Perl space, but is still very close
to the C++ API. P4 is much more perl like.

Requirements
------------

P4::Client >= 1.931
Perforce Client API - get it from ftp://ftp.perforce.com/pub/perforce


Feedback
--------

All suggestions, bug reports etc. to tony@perforce.com - thanks!
